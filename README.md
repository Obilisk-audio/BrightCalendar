## POJO's

We have also used POJO's (Plain Old Java Objects) within our project. Here are some listed below.

- User - id, name, email, password
- ToDoList - id, name, date, time
- Notes - id, name


## CRUD functions / Commands

We have applied CRUD functionality to each class. Here are some listed below:

## Further Implementations and Extensions

For the extensions our team had come up with a number a great ideas to implement within our project, some of these include:

- Providing the user a Google sign in option instead of registering.
- Calendar....
- Adding and customising to a users desired color scheme
- Create groups of users to use a shared page
